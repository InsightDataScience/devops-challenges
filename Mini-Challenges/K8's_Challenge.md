## K8's(Ansible + Terraform) Challenge 

The goal of this challenge is to deploy Kubernetes on AWS with Terraform and Ansible. However, we are not deploying EKS we are deploying kuberentes the *hard way*[[1]](https://opencredo.com/blogs/kubernetes-aws-terraform-ansible-1/)[[2]](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way). 

## Objective
As a team you will work together on 1 github repo to build your k8s cluster. Repo should contain a README with set up instructions and the code should be commented. This is due 1 week from now. 

 1. Spin up infrastructure with Terraform 
 2. Configure instances with Ansible playbooks
 3. Deploy Prometheus and Grafana onto your groups k8s cluster.
 4. Build a Grafana dashboard to monitor your groups k8's cluster.
