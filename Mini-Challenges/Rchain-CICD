## Rchain-CD/CD

The objective of this challenge is to build a CI/CD pipeline to support Rchain development, dockerize Rchain, and test the dockr image by deploying a 100 node testnet. 

## Objective
As a team you will work together on 1 github repo to build CI/CD pipeline for Rchain. Repo should contain a README with set up instructions and the code should be commented.  This is due 1 week from now.

1. Set up a Jenkins CI pipeline that checks for the following
  * Check Rusts syntax / compliation
  * Builds a new docker image 
2. Configure ArgoCD to deploy the docker image to an EKS cluster.
3. After ArgoCD deploys the container, scale up the EKS cluster to replicate a 100 node testnet. 
4. Screenshot the cluster running the testnet & terminal output of the testnet running!
5. Build a presentation that covers CI/CD pipeline for a large EKS cluster.
